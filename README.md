I am a motivated and industrious human being, with a proven track record as an educator and musician. Having graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa I am keen to explore how I can integrate my previous skillset and experience with my newly found love of tech and coding. 

My teaching experience has endowed me with the ability to distil and clarify complex concepts, a skill that I find invaluable when crafting code and working in teams. My proficiency in music technology has paved the way for a seamless transition to web development tools. My project management skills translate directly to working to deadlines and contributing to a positive team culture. The creative thinking I've developed through music also plays a critical role in my approach to problem-solving and devising innovative solutions. 

There's a substantial overlap in the discipline that music and coding demand. Both fields require relentless practice, a keen eye for detail, and an unwavering commitment to lifelong learningâ€”qualities that my time at Dev Academy has further solidified.

In addition to my performance career, I possess expertise in music-related subjects such as music technology, performance, and musicology. I have been involved in program design at both tertiary and school levels and have contributed to the development of music technology unit standards. I have conducted workshops on popular music analysis for secondary school teachers, participated in the Music Subject Experts Group, and reviewed achievement standards for NCEA levels 1-3.

I form one half of the band Goldsmith Baynes, which released an album in 2022, contributing to the Waiata Anthems series and headlining the Tauranga Jazz festival and the Auckland Arts Festival 2023. Goldsmith Baynes is broadcast regularly on Radio New Zealand and has featured on international shows such as Jazz FM(UK), the BBC, and the CBC. My notable experiences in the music industry include being a guest arranger for the Royal New Zealand Ballet's production of Hansel and Gretel, composed by Claire Cowan. The production was recorded for an award-winning album by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra in 2020, which received recognition at the AMA (Aotearoa Music Awards) in 2021. In collaboration with Troy Kingi and Mireya Ramos, I co-wrote the single "Dreams," set to be released soon. Additionally, I co-wrote an album with Latin Grammy Award Winner Mireya Ramos of Flor de Toloache (US).
